# CompilersAssignment

In this assignment, you will need to do some (simple) research and read about denite clause
grammars . Using Prolog, write a parser for a denite clause grammar of English-Light . English-
Light is a fragment of English (i.e., English-Light does not include any ungrammatical English
sentences) which accounts to structures as those appearing in the following examples.
a) The young boy who worked for the old man pushed and stored a big box in the large
empty room after school.
b) The old woman and the old man gave the poor young man a white envelope in the shed
behind the building.
c) Every boy quickly climbed some big tree while every girl secretly watched some boy.
d) Some brilliant students and many professors watched and admired talented lecturers
and appreciated bright scientists and researchers.
Your lexicon should include all the words appearing in the examples above, at least twenty
nouns, at least twenty verbs (with the past tense inection), at least twenty adjectives, at least
ten adverbs, at least ten prepositions, and at least ten determiners.
Your grammar should contain no Îµ -rules and should have the symbol s as its start variable.
A successful parse should result in building a parse tree for the input; make sure your parser
generates such a tree. We linearly represent a parse tree as follows:
a) l , where l is the label of a leaf.
b) p(l1, l2, . . . , ln) , where p is a label of a parent node and li is the i th sub-tree thereof,
where left-to-right order is assumed.
